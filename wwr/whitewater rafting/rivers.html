                    <h2>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>
                    <p>This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. Grand Canyon river rafting combines 
                        world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience. 
                        The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins 
                        accessible only by river. The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X, to accommodate such a wide variety of 
                        rapids and river variances.

                    <h2>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h2>
                    <p>Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the 
                        mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. 
                        Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days.

                    <h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
                    <p>Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River 
                        of No Return by the people living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of 
                        the river that they never left. The rapids range from class I-IV. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the 
                        early summer and lower, slower, and  warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to 
                        swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.</p>
