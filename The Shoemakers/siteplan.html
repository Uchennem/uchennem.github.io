      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I believe websites should be simple and intuitive. Time should be spent making decisions about services on the website and not on trying to navigate the website. I make websites that are simple and intuitive to use. My purpose in creating this site is to offer an easily navigable website with great shoes at an affordable price. Life is a journey and each step you take matters. With The Shoemakers' shoes, you will never stop halfway. At The Shoemakers', you would find a shoe unique to your style and tailored for your feet, at a great quality.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        What do our Customers need to know<br>
        The site is intuitive. You do not need to know much about shoes to use the site.  They are different categories from gender-specific shoe 
        category, to event-specific (semi-casual to formal). That is all the information you need for a good experience on the site.  The reason 
        you would come here is that you not only choose a shoe style but would be given an opportunity to speak with its maker. This is all to 
        improve the “A Shoe by You and For You Experience”.
